# Tink-Tally
Level up your math skills — from basics to brain-busters! Solve puzzles, race against time, and learn with videos and notes. Fun, fast, and educational!"

Inspiration

We were inspired by the idea of making math fun and accessible for students of all levels. Many middle schoolers struggle with math concepts, so we wanted to create an engaging platform that combines learning with interactive challenges. By offering both basic and advanced math puzzles, we aim to motivate students to sharpen their skills while enjoying the process.

What it does

Our project, Think & Tally, is a math challenge website divided into two categories:

Basic: Simple math challenges designed for younger students or those just starting their math journey.

Advanced: More complex math puzzles to test and develop critical thinking skills.

The platform also includes helpful learning resources:

YouTube video links to explain math concepts.

Educational notes from reliable websites to dive deeper into the math behind each challenge.

To make the experience even more exciting, certain levels feature a timer to add a sense of urgency and fun.

How we built it

We built the website using:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end design and interactivity.

Responsive design techniques to ensure the site works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

GitHub for version control and collaboration.

Challenges we ran into

Timer implementation: Designing a timer that seamlessly integrates into the advanced levels required careful thought.

Content curation: Finding reliable, easy-to-understand YouTube videos and educational notes that matched our puzzles took time and effort.

Balancing difficulty: Ensuring the basic challenges were beginner-friendly while keeping the advanced puzzles thought-provoking was a tricky balance.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Successfully creating a clear structure with two categories for different math levels.

Integrating external learning resources like videos and notes to support students’ understanding.

Designing a user-friendly interface that’s both educational and engaging.

What we learned

How to use timers and interactive elements in JavaScript.

The importance of user experience, especially for educational platforms.

Effective content sourcing to provide accurate and accessible learning materials.

What's next for Think & Tally

Reward system: Introducing a point-based system where users earn badges or certificates for completing levels.

Progress tracking: Allowing students to save their progress and pick up where they left off.

More math topics: Expanding into areas like geometry, algebra, and word problems.

Multiplayer mode: Letting students compete in real-time math battles to make learning even more exciting.

We’re excited to keep building and making math fun for everyone!
